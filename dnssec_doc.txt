My implementation of DNSSEC is as follows:

First thing to do is to verify the validity of root zone ".",
for checking the validity of messages come from root zone we need
to do following things:

   Apply for the DNSKEY of root zone, using dnspython this is achieved
   by sending a special request to root zone:

   request = dns.message.make_query('.', dns.rdatatype.DNSKEY, want_dnssec=True, payload=2048)
   response = dns.query.udp(request, rootserver, timeout=3)

   If success, the response will have the root zone's DNSKEY inside of its answer section,
   as well as the signature of this DNSKEY, also inside the answer section of same response.
   Then we first check the validity of this DNSKEY by decrypting the signature using public
   key-signing-key that is contained in the DNSKEY and compare the result with the DNSKEY
   that we got. Then second thing we do is to verify the DS record (from observation this 
   is always inside the authority section in the response, notice this is a different response
   with the one above, which is the response of "normal" request we send out, means the request
   that we are trying to get actual answer we want from, in dnspython this can be achieved by
   enable a specific flag (want_dnssec) when we make the request:

   request = dns.message.make_query(domainText, dns.rdatatype.A, want_dnssec=True, payload=2048)

   Then we fetch the DS record as well as the signature of this DS record from response's authority section,
   use the public zone-signing-key to decrypt the signature and compare it with the DS.

   Last thing we do is to verify the root zone by comparing the public key-signing-key that we received
   with the two knowing keys that can be found online, this verification of root zone has to be trusted
   since it's the start of this "trust chain".


Above is the step of verifying root zone's integrity, basically in each of the iterations of resolving
we do the same things except that the following steps have different zone verifying process: for verifying
zones other than the root zone, we compare the hash of its public key-signing-key with the DS record that
comes from its parent zone. We repeat same steps until we find the final answer we want, if any of these
steps failed validation during the process, we output validation failed.
